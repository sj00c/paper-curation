### TOOL ECOSYSTEM (show as interconnected logos/icons at the top)
The system is orchestrated by **Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI agent) which coordinates five tools:
- **Zotero** (reference manager, red Z logo): paper collection, PDF storage, linked files
- **Claude** (Anthropic LLM, Anthropic logo): structured reviews (Haiku), topic naming (Sonnet), timeline narratives (Opus), Deep Research answers (Extended Thinking)
- **PaperBanana** (diagram engine, banana icon): auto-generates per-category research trend timeline diagrams from Claude Opus narratives
- **Obsidian** (knowledge IDE, purple gem logo): personal notes editing, [[wiki-links]] between papers, Graph View for cross-query knowledge topology
- **Google Gemini** (Google logo): gemini-embedding-001 for the Deep Research RAG index, figure validation, and Audio Overview TTS
- **Local LLM** (small server/home icon, OPTIONAL): Ollama/LM Studio fallback that completes Related-Papers connections when the network to Anthropic is down

Data flow: Zotero → Claude Code → Claude (review/classify) → PaperBanana (timelines) → Deep Research (RAG Q&A) → Obsidian (compounding knowledge)

Each tool MUST be represented by its recognizable logo/icon. Show Claude Code as the central orchestrator connecting all tools.

### CORE vs OPTION (CRITICAL — must be visually distinguishable!)
- **CORE (always runs, solid style)**: data collection → structured review → topic modeling/classification → Related Papers connections → category summaries + timelines → Deep Research index → topic index page → `node ./bin/paper-curation.mjs serve --topic <alias>` → browser requests a localhost server action plan, explicit approval, and status.
- **OPTION (opt-in, dashed-border zones, each zone labeled with a small "OPTION" badge/ribbon)**:
  * O-1 Research Insights + Network (`--insights`): cross-category insights analysis + interactive network visualization
  * Local LLM fallback (`--local-fallback`): Ollama/LM Studio completes stranded connections during network outages
  * Workflow diagram generation (this very diagram, standalone)
  * Legacy deployment: a distinct, dedicated operation that is outside this local workflow and requires separate approval.
- Core flow uses solid arrows/borders; every Option element lives inside a clearly dashed enclosure with an "OPTION" tag. A reader must instantly see "this part is optional".

### PIPELINE PHASES (left to right flow)

{chr(10).join(phases) if phases else "(No pipeline steps found in README.md or CLAUDE.md)"}

### PROJECT STRUCTURE
{structure_section}

### DATA ARCHITECTURE
{architecture_section}

### MODE DECISION LOGIC (diamond shapes)
{modes_section}

### KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES
{design_section}

### CANONICAL WORKFLOW GRAPH (use this only for build-time data flow; do not
### reproduce obsolete browser-provider, email, Worker, or deployment nodes)
{mermaid_block}

### LOCAL BROWSER BOUNDARY (must be visible in the diagram, separate from
### the build-time pipeline above)
- The only local serving command is `node ./bin/paper-curation.mjs serve --topic <alias>`, bound to localhost.
- Generated pages hold no credentials and make no direct provider requests. They load owned local JS/CSS assets and pass non-executable JSON bootstrap data only.
- Deep Research and Audio are same-origin localhost server actions: browser → `/api/action/plan` → explicit user approval → `/api/action/approve` → `/api/action/start` → status/final. The server is authoritative for credentials, providers, limits, and work.
- Audio appears only when the `AudioCapabilityV1` bootstrap state is `AVAILABLE`; an unavailable Gemini capability hides and disables Audio without probing or fallback.

### DELIVERY BOUNDARY (must appear as a clearly separate, non-default note)
- LOCAL: the Node serve/action boundary above is the complete local browsing path.
- DEPLOY: legacy and distinct from this workflow. It is never automatic, has no browser provider or email path, and requires dedicated separate approval before any deployment operation.

VISUAL_RULES_DEFAULT = """
### ABSOLUTE VISUAL RULES
- Left to right flow, 21:9 ultra-wide aspect ratio
- Each phase box: SHORT label (1-2 words max) + a representative ICON/CLIPART inside or beside it
- Phase labels must be minimal: "Search", "Register", "Review", "Classify", "Insights", "Timeline", "Network", "Validate", "HTML", "Deep Research", "Obsidian"
- Icons/cliparts are the primary visual — text is secondary
- Example icons: magnifying glass (Search), book stack (Register), quill pen (Review), tag/folder (Classify), lightbulb (Insights), clock/timeline bar (Timeline), web/graph nodes (Network), checkmark (Validate), code brackets (HTML), brain/sparkle (Deep Research), purple gem (Obsidian)
- Decision diamonds for mode switches (--update, --category, --timeline) with minimal labels
- Fan-out / fan-in arrows for parallel operations
- Dashed lines for optional/skippable paths
- CORE vs OPTION: Core flow solid; every OPTION group (Deploy O-1, Insights+Network O-2,
  Local LLM fallback, Workflow diagram) inside a dashed rounded enclosure with a small
  "OPTION" ribbon/badge on its corner — instantly distinguishable from the Core flow
- White background, clean modern style, soft rounded shapes
- NO verbose descriptions in boxes — icons speak louder than words
- NO title text, NO watermarks, NO color name labels
- English only
- Show recognizable logos/icons for these tools near the stages they power:
  * Claude Code (Anthropic terminal CLI icon) — central orchestrator
  * Zotero (red Z logo) — paper source
  * Claude (Anthropic logo) — LLM review/classify/insights/Deep Research
  * PaperBanana (banana icon) — timeline diagram generation
  * Obsidian (purple gem icon) — knowledge compounding destination
  * Google Gemini (Google logo) — Deep Research embeddings + figure validation + TTS
  * Local LLM (tiny home-server icon, inside the OPTION zone) — offline connections fallback
"""

VISUAL_RULES_ACADEMIC = """
### ABSOLUTE VISUAL RULES — ACADEMIC PAPER FIGURE
The diagram must look like a *method overview figure* from a top-tier ML/NLP conference
paper (NeurIPS/ICML/ACL). Serious, restrained, information-dense.

LAYOUT
- Left-to-right horizontal flow, 21:9 ultra-wide aspect ratio
- Four swim lanes stacked vertically, left-to-right logical flow inside each lane:
  1. ACQUIRE  (Web search → Zotero registration → Sync → Dedup)
  2. REVIEW   (PDF → Text+Figures → Sanity gate → Structured review)
  3. ANALYZE  (Embedding → Cluster assignment → Category summaries → Cross-category insights → Timeline narrative)
  4. DELIVER  (Validate → Topic page → Search index → Local serve/action boundary → Recovery audit)

NODE STYLE
- Rectangles with thin 1.5px black borders, subtle off-white fill (#F7F7F5)
- Short 1-3 word concept labels in bold serif (e.g. "Embedding", "Cluster Assignment", "Sanity Gate")
- NO filenames, NO .py, NO command-line flags, NO script paths
- Optional: tiny monochrome pictogram (magnifying glass, document, graph node) in node corner — not the primary visual
- Tool logos allowed ONLY as small badges next to the relevant lane label: Zotero, Claude, OpenAI, PaperBanana, Obsidian

EDGES
- Solid thin arrows for primary data flow
- Dashed arrows for optional / preflight paths (dedup preflight, audit recovery)
- CORE vs OPTION: Core nodes/edges solid; OPTION groups (Research Insights+Network O-1,
  Local LLM fallback) enclosed in thin dashed rounded rectangles, each with a small
  italic "Option" label at the enclosure corner. Show legacy deployment only as a
  separate note outside the workflow, labeled "separate approval required."
- Diamond decision nodes only for the local MECE mode gate
  ("mode: curate / rebuild / reclassify / retime")
- No thick colored edges; monochrome black arrows

ANNOTATIONS
- Below each lane, a thin italic one-line caption describing what that lane produces
  (e.g. "structured Korean reviews with extracted figures", "hybrid node-based classification")
- Top-left: small bold serif title "Paper Curation Pipeline"
- Bottom-right: tiny italic "single entrypoint orchestrates all stages"
- English only, no color names, no watermarks

PALETTE
- Mostly grayscale (#000 / #333 / #666 / #F7F7F5)
- Accent: at most two muted academic colors (#2C5F9E navy, #B23A3A brick) used sparingly
  — one for the sanity/validate gates, one for the LLM/embedding nodes
- No neon, no gradients, no drop shadows

FORBIDDEN
- No cartoon characters, mascots, emojis, chibi figures
- No gradients, glow, neon, 3D effects
- No file names, no argparse flags, no code snippets, no bracketed command args
- No long sentences inside nodes

### CUTE CAT AGENT CHARACTERS (IMPORTANT!)
- Each pipeline phase has an adorable cat agent character sitting on, beside, or interacting with the phase box
- Cats are small chibi/kawaii style, each with a distinct look matching their role:
{char_list}
- NO speech bubbles — the cat's action IS the phase (cat with magnifying glass = Search, cat with quill = Review)
- Cats may have small accessories: scarves, bow ties, or tiny hats matching their phase color
- Style: flat kawaii illustration, soft pastel colors, round shapes, consistent size across all cats
- Cats ARE the icons — each cat's pose/action replaces a traditional icon
- Small paw prints or yarn balls as decorative connectors between phases
- CORE vs OPTION (IMPORTANT): Core cats sit along the main solid path. OPTION features
  (Deploy O-1, Research Insights + Network O-2, Local LLM fallback) are dashed-fence
  "play pens" — each pen has a tiny wooden sign reading "OPTION", and the cats inside
  wear a small star-shaped name tag. A reader must instantly see which cats are optional.
- The Local LLM fallback pen contains a cozy cat napping next to a tiny home server
  (it only wakes up when the cloud is unreachable — show tiny zzz)

### FAIRY AGENT CHARACTERS (IMPORTANT!)

- Each fairy has a tiny speech bubble with one keyword (e.g., "Search!", "Review!", "Research!")
