"""
Global paper connections management.

All topics share a single global connections file (docs/papers/_global_connections.json).
Topic-specific _paper_connections.json files are derived from global by filtering.

This ensures cross-topic connections are preserved regardless of execution order.

The global file stores the *raw, directional* edges exactly as generated (one
``source_topic``-tagged entry per A→B). The per-topic ``_paper_connections.json``
files — which every renderer consumes — are derived as a **bidirectional,
per-target-deduped** view: each A→B edge implies B→A (relation flipped), and a
paper connected for several reasons appears once with all reasons listed. See
:func:`make_bidirectional_deduped`.
