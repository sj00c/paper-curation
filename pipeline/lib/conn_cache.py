"""Incremental paper-connection cache (cost control for full-corpus regen).

The expensive path in the pipeline is the *full* connection generation that
paper-curio consumes for inbound/hub edges:
  - ``extract_insights.extract_paper_connections``  (top_k=25)
  - ``topic_modeling`` Step 6                        (top_k=5)

Both build a per-paper top-k candidate dict with
``compute_related_candidates`` (pure numpy, cheap) and then call
``generate_connections_from_candidates`` which fires **one LLM call per key**
in that dict. So the cost is proportional to ``len(candidates)``.

This module lets the integration layer restrict that candidate dict to only the
papers whose connections can actually have changed since the last run — the
*dirty* set — while still saving the FULL current top-k membership so the next
diff is correct.

THE HUB TRAP (why "new-only" is wrong, and how this fixes it):
  When a new paper N is added, an *old* paper O may now have N inside its top-k
  (pushing out O's former #k neighbor). For N to receive its inbound link, O→N
  must be (re)generated. A naive "only the new slug" diff misses O silently and
  the graph quietly thins out. The fix here is the **membership-changed** rule:
  a slug is dirty if its current top-k SET differs from the cached one — this
  covers both gained AND lost candidates, closing the hub trap.

Downstream, ``lib.connections.sync_topic_connections`` only rewrites edges for
slugs present in the dict it is handed (``merge_to_global`` leaves everyone else
untouched) and then ``make_bidirectional_deduped`` synthesizes reverse/inbound
edges for the whole global store for free. So passing only the dirty slugs is
safe: unchanged papers keep their prior edges, and the new inbound links are
materialized at no extra LLM cost.

SAFETY: the diff is wrapped so that ANY error returns the FULL candidate set
(correct but costly) — never a silently-thin graph. The integration layer also
exposes ``CONN_INCREMENTAL`` / ``CONN_FULL_REBUILD`` toggles; this module stays
toggle-agnostic and just takes a ``force`` flag.

Import-light on purpose: stdlib only (no umap/hdbscan/sentence-transformers),
so the integration points pay nothing to import it.
