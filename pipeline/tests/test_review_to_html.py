"""Focused test for review_to_html._resolve_target_slugs.

Locks the per-paper render target resolution that drives the new
``--with-connected`` feature (re-render a paper's connection neighbours so a new/
changed edge shows its reverse on the neighbour's own page), and guards the
comma-`--slugs` regression where a raw string was iterated character-by-character
(matching almost the whole corpus instead of the two requested papers).

Pure function — no file IO, no rendering. Run:
  PYTHONUTF8=1 /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/py312/bin/python \
      pipeline/tests/test_review_to_html.py
